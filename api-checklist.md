- [ ]  Are there integration tests in place that test the API as a whole?
- [ ]  Have the tests been run against a staging or QA environment?
- [ ]  Is there a process for regularly updating and maintaining test cases?
- [ ]  Have you performed security vulnerability assessments and penetration testing?

## 4. Error Handling

- [ ]  Does the API provide meaningful error messages?
- [ ]  Are errors returned with appropriate HTTP status codes?
- [ ]  Have you handled edge cases and potential exceptions?
- [ ]  Is there a consistent format for error responses across different endpoints?
- [ ]  Have you documented common errors and their resolutions for client developers?

## 5. Security

- [ ]  Have you implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms?
- [ ]  Have you considered and mitigated common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF, XSS)?
- [ ]  Is sensitive data encrypted during transit and at rest?
- [ ]  Are rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in place to prevent abuse?
- [ ]  Have you conducted a security audit or a code review for critical components?

## 6. Performance & Scalability

- [ ]  Have you conducted performance testing under expected load?
- [ ]  Have you considered caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data?
- [ ]  Is the system architected to handle increased load if necessary?
- [ ]  Have you evaluated the API performance across different geographical regions?
- [ ]  Is there a strategy for horizontal scaling (e.g., load balancing)?

## 7. Monitoring & Logging

- [ ]  Are there mechanisms in place to monitor the health of the API?
- [ ]  Have you set up logging to capture important events and potential issues?
- [ ]  Are there alerts set up for critical errors or downtime?
- [ ]  Have you set up performance metrics and benchmarks for normal operation?
- [ ]  Is there a centralized logging system for easier issue tracking?

## 8. Versioning

- [ ]  Have you implemented a versioning strategy (e.g., via the URI, headers)?
- [ ]  Is there a plan for handling breaking changes?
- [ ]  Are deprecated features and versions documented and communicated effectively?
- [ ]  Is there a policy for supporting older API versions?

## 9. Dependencies

- [ ]  Have all external dependencies been reviewed and vetted?
- [ ]  Are there backup plans or failovers for critical third-party services?
- [ ]  Is there a process for regularly updating and patching dependencies?
- [ ]  Have you identified and documented the criticality of each external dependency?

## 10. Backup & Recovery

- [ ]  Have you set up regular backups for critical data?
- [ ]  Is there a disaster recovery plan in place?
- [ ]  Have you tested the recovery process to ensure it works as expected?
- [ ]  Are backup and recovery procedures documented and easily executable?

## 11. Deployment

- [ ]  Is there a rollback strategy in case of deployment failures?
- [ ]  Have you ensured that there's minimal downtime during deployment?
- [ ]  Have you considered using feature flags for smoother rollouts and rollbacks?
- [ ]  Is there a process for post-deployment validation to ensure everything is working as expected?

## 12. Feedback & Support

- [ ]  Is there a clear channel for users to provide feedback or report issues?
- [ ]  Have you set up support documentation or FAQs for common queries?
- [ ]  Have you established metrics to gauge user satisfaction and API usability?
- [ ]  Is there an established procedure for addressing and prioritizing user feedback?
